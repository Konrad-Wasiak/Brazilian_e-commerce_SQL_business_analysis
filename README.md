# Brazilian-e-commerce---SQL-business-analysis
<h4>Goal of the project</h4>
<p>My aim is to analyse business data deriving from a Brazilian e-commerce company, Olist.
<br>More specifically, I created a reational database from the provided csv files and was gaining data insights from a marketing point of view, to provide analysis potentially helpful in developing business strategies.</p>

<h4>Source of data</h4> 
I took data from Kaggle, posted there by the company itself:
